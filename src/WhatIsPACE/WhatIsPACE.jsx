          instead of looking for aliens, it's looking for tiny, tiny things

          <b> plankton</b>! That spaceship is called "PACE".

          plankton in real life are a bit like Plankton, but they're 
          <b> much smaller</b> and live in

         <p className="IzqPar2"> PACE is a very special spaceship because it can see things that we
          can't from <i>Earth</i>. It can see tiny things floating in the air
          called <b>aerosols</b>. Aerosols are like tiny clouds, and they can
          affect how the sun's light gets to the ocean.

          <u>plankton and the aerosols are working together</u>. It's like a

          By understanding how plankton and aerosols work, we <i>can</i> learn
          more about our planet and <b>keep it healthy</b>.

          school? Well, dust, which is a type of aerosols, can make you have
          allergies. The PACE satellite will help measure dust, which can help
          everyone on planet Earth, ensuring they don't get allergic!

          give you oxygen, which helps you breathe!
