          Imagine a big, <i>friendly</i> spaceship that flies around Earth, but
          instead of looking for aliens, it's looking for tiny, tiny things
          called
          <b> plankton</b>! That spaceship is called "PACE".

          Plankton from SpongeBob SquarePants? He's a <sup>tiny, </sup>
          <mark id="mark">green</mark>
          &nbsp;creature that always wants the Krabby Patty formula. Well,
          plankton in real life are a bit like Plankton, but they're
          <b>much smaller</b> and live in
          <b> the ocean</b>.

          PACE is a very special spaceship because it can see things that we
          can't from <i>Earth</i>. It can see tiny things floating in the air
          called <b>aerosols</b>. Aerosols are like tiny clouds, and they can
          affect how the sun's light gets to the ocean.
        </p>

          When PACE looks at the ocean, it can see how the
          <u>plankton and the aerosols are working together</u>. It's like a
          <u>detective solving a puzzle! </u>
          By understanding how plankton and aerosols work, we <i>can</i> learn
          more about our planet and <b>keep it healthy</b>.

          Have you ever had very bad allergies? So bad that you have had to miss
          school? Well, dust, which is a type of aerosols, can make you have
          allergies. The PACE satellite will help measure dust, which can help
          everyone on planet Earth, ensuring they don't get allergic!

          Now, I'm SURE everyone reading this loves fish. Measuring how many
          planktons there are, you can now how many fishes there are. They also
          give you oxygen, which helps you breathe!

          So, while Plankton from SpongeBob may not be great, real planktons are
          great living things!
